This is intended to be a starting point for javascript projects.

It uses RequireJS and presents a project structure that you can then turn into
a full-featured javascript project. (At least hopefully.) It provides d3,
jquery, backbone, and underscore.

The index.html file has to be served. This can be done with any server that you
like. An easy one is:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888

This will start a web server on port 8888 on your local machine, in the www
directory. It will be serving the contents of your working directory when you
run the command. Navigate to 127.0.0.1:8888/app and there you go.

I constructed this based on the following video, which was extremely helpful:
http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/a-requirejs-backbone-and-bower-starter-template/


Setup:

It relies on the presence of several libraries in the vendor directory, which
it assumes you'll install using bower. This can be done using:

bower install

to get the necessary packages in place. Make sure you do it in the www
directory, which has the component.json file.

If you don't have bower, install it with npm. If you don't have npm, you need
node. The following commands worked on OSX with homebrew installed.

brew install node
npm install -g bower

content.js is the file you should then be editing. Start a server, navigate to
app/index.html, and open the javascript console. If things are working, you'll
see a log statement indicating that the onReady() function of content.js has
been called. You can now begin editing!
