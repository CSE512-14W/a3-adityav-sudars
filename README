I set this up as a starting point for javascript projects. The file has to be
served, either from OS X 10.7's file sharing or presumably python's server,
which can be run using:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888

and it then serves things from the directory you run it in.

You also have to run 

bower install

to get the necessary packages in place. Make sure you do it from the right
directory, I think the root of the www directory.

If you don't have bower, install it with npm. If you don't have npm, you need
node. Try something like the following for mac on the above date:

brew install node
npm install -g bower

That then worked for me.

bacteria.js is the file you should then be editing.
