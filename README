This is assignment three for University of Washington (UW) CSE 512, Data
Visualization.

It maps calling data to an IVR system.

The index.html file has to be served. This can be done with any server that you
like. An easy one is:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

This will start a web server on port 8000 on your local machine, in the www
directory. It will be serving the contents of your working directory when you
run the command. Navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000/app and there you go.
